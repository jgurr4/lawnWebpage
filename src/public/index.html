			 <h3 class="d">How much does it cost?</h3>
			 <p class="b">Our philosophy is that we are getting to do 
			 something that we love, and you can't really put a 
			 price on that. But doing a service like this does 
			 cost us to operate. In the end though, you can expect
			 very competitive prices, and very fair contracts
			 for whatever you need us to do.</p>

			 specific yard needs. But, have no fear! We are experienced
			 professionals with deep understanding of what it takes to make your lawn green.

			 <h3 class="d">How to have a perfect yard?</h3>
			 <p class="d">We believe the science behind having a perfect lawn
			 is custom care and maintenance. Your lawn is not the 
			 same as other people's. You may have specific features
			 that makes your lawn unique. We'll make sure that 
			 whatever your needs are, in the end, the result will
			 be a healthy green lawn.</p>
