   <section>
    <h3 class="services">Mowing/Edging</h3>
     <p id="p2">For this basic service, I will bring my equipment to your 
		 residence and cut the grass to a healthy desired height 
		 based on the type of grass you have. Then I will take any 
		 grass clippings off-site to dispose of them myself, or 
		 reintroduce them to your yard/plants for extra nitrogen
		 if you want. This service is available to schedule 
		 weekly, biweekly, or monthly. </p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3 class="services">Weed Control</h3>
		<p id="p2">Part of keeping a healthy yard is also preventing invasive 
		plants from becoming part of it. The weeds can easily multiply
		when left alone for too long making even a otherwise healthy 
		looking grass lawn cluttered and much less appealing. For 
		this service I will spray the weeds with a herbicide tailored
		specifically to kill that particular weed species while also
		avoiding damage to the surrounding grass. There are also 
		methods of prevention that are important to understand
		in the fight against weeds.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3 class="services">Leaf Blowing/Sweeping</h3>
     <p id="p2">Is your patio cluttered with leaves or debris? Need 
		 someone to de-clutter all the stuff that is tarnishing
		 the beauty of your home? Then this is where we can come in
		 and sweep/leaf blow any messes that are currently plaguing
		 your walkways, and we'll take it away with us to dump 
		 elsewhere.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3 class="services">Trimming, Pruning, and Shaping shrubs/bushes</h3>
		<p id="p2">Are the bushes getting overgrown to the point that they
		just look like a mess of branches/leaves? Do you wish that 
		they were a little neater or shaped in a more pleasing way?
		We can help with that! We'll bring our tools to cut away 
		excess branches and shape the plants to whatever size or
		shape you best prefer. </p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3 class="services">Aeration</h3>
     <p id="p2">Aeration is a technique where small holes are created and
		 spaced evenly apart throughout a grass lawn with the 
		 intention of loosening the soil to allow more nutrients
		 /water to reach the roots. Lawns with compacted soil can
		 benefit from this since the hard soil causes the grass
		 roots to have a harder time reaching deeper, and also
		 makes any fertilizer/grass seeds/water have a harder time 
		 sinking into the soil to be absorbed by grass roots.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3 class="services">Overseeding</h3>
		<p id="p2">Is your lawn thinner than most? Do you see bare spots of
		dirt between the blades of grass? Or do you just need to have
		a different type of grass seed to prepare for winter? If so, 
		this is the service you'll need! Just tell us what the 
		need is, and the type of seed you want, and we'll use a 
		custom technique to ensure any thin/bare spots get the best
		opportunity to fill in.</p>
   </section>
	 <section>
		<h3 class="services">Fertilizing</h3>
		<p id="p2">Fertilizer is best for lawns which seem to be losing their
		lush color. The blades of grass may be looking thinner, droopy
		and dry looking. And they will be more susceptible to dying 
		when being stepped on. For this service, we would bring some
		high quality fertilizer and spread it around the entire lawn
		with a spreader tool. Get the best looking yard by opting in
		for this service.</p>

<!--To-do list: 
1: Add picture(optional: do paralax scrolling. At least add a gallery at bottom.
2: Add a 'Request a Quote' form page.
3: Add business hours either on the main page, or on contact page. Also add 
map of area of service, decide whether to put on main or contact or Quote page.
4: Decide if I want to put services on its own page rather than on the main.
5: On main page consider doing a format with text and pictures beside the text
with the main goal of being to convince people of the benefits of getting their 
lawns scheduled with us. For example, have first picture be some interesting fact
about the science of lawn care and a neat picture/diagram or just good looking 
yard next to it. The second one could be how we do very fair prices, and the third
could be about how easy it is to sign up for weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly service 
At the bottom could be the get a quote button which will take to the quote page.
6: try to figure out how it would work to have a scheduling form with a database
that I could see and edit as I see fit. Specifically decide if this should also
be on quote page, or on it's own, or on main page.
7: add a footer on every page as well as an aside that will be reserved for ads.
Here are the possible names of pages: Home Contact About Map Quote Services Gallery
These are the features you can consider doing for each page: Home(sell idea, 
parallax scrolling background photo, Services, 
quote button, gallery at bottom/in footer) Contact(business hours/contact info, map
of area of service, gallery at bottom/in footer) About(philosophy/ethos, small 
bio-paragraph about me and my goals, gallery at bottom/in footer) Map(map of area
of service, business hours/contact info, gallery at bottom/in footer)
Quote(quote form/service scheduler, possibly include services descriptions here and 
pricing so they will know what to request. map of area of service, business hours, 
contact information, gallery at bottom/in footer) Services(description/prices of 
services, map of area of service, quote form/service scheduler, business hours,
contact information, gallery at bottom/in footer) Gallery(just gallery)
8: make side of pages and top and bottom have a parallax scrolling picture,
and anything inside a container will contain the main features of that page along
with the cool background I created in css. if it ends up looking bad, just revert 
back to master branch and start from there doing other goals.-->
